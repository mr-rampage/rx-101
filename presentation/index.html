        <h1>Reactive Streams</h1>
        <h2>... with Reactive eXtensions</h2>
      </div>

<!-- 
  Reactive streams is a form of the functional reactive programming paradigm.
  It's the result of having big data and having the desire to understand that
  data quickly.
 -->

      <div class="step">
        <h2>Problems</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Concurrent programming - Cloud, Multi-Core, Multi-Server</li>
          <li>Asychronous &amp; event based computation</li>
          <li>Consume asynchronous data</li>
          <li>Reduce blocking on web services</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

<!--
  Around 2010 - 2013, four companies were trying to solve similiar problems.

  Microsoft was trying to allow developers to program against a common interface
  for concurrent programming across cloud resources and multiple cores.

  NetFlix was working on solving their problems with minimizing network traffic
  while maximizing their processor utilization through concurrent programming.

  LightBend/TypeSafe was working on adding features to their Play framework that
  would allow them to consume asynchronous data. Their product Akka IO was too
  low level to be usable.

  Pivotal was working on reducing blocking on their web services with Project
  Reactor.

  Futures/Promises and callbacks were too simple to solve the problems they were
  trying to solve.

        <blockquote>
          <p>A team united cannot be defeated.</p>
          <p>- Voltron: Defender of the Universe</p>
        </blockquote>
      </div>

<!--
  As voltron once said, "A team united cannot be defeated". In this story the
  solution was collaboration.

  Anyone know the other famous quote by Voltron?

        <blockquote>
          <p>Form feet and legs! Form arms and torso! And I'll form the head!</p>
          <p>- Voltron: Defender of the Universe</p>
        </blockquote>
      </div>

<!-- 
  LightBend, being the torso, brought NetFlix, Microsoft, Pivotal, Twitter, and
  GitHub to the table to try and solve their shared problems.

        <h2>Reactive Streams specification</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Java 9 - java.util.concurrent.Flow</li>
          <li>JavaScript (ES 7... maybe 8?) - es-observables</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Work on standardizing processors TBD.</p>
      </div>

<!--
  The result of their collaboration was the Reactive Streams specification. 
  It's a set of 4 interfaces that allow developers to build reactive systems 
  without requiring low-level knowledge needed to build responsive, resilient, 
  and elastic components.

  Elastic - the system should react to varying workloads by managing resources.

  Two goals of the specification are to ensure implementations:
    Manage stream data across asychronous boundaries (threads, networks, ...)
    Ensuring consumers are not forced to buffer any data
-->

      <div class="step">
        <h2>Implementations</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>NetFlix RxJava (Java 6+)</li>
          <li>Lightbend Akka</li>
          <li>Spring Reactor/Spring 5</li>
          <li>RedHat Vert.x</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Rx.js (IE 6+)</li>
          <li>Kefir.js</li>
          <li>Bacon.js</li>
          <li>most.js</li>
        </ul>

<!-- 
  There are several Java based implementations and they are all compatible with
  each other. As well, there are several Javascript implementations, but I'm
  unsure whether or not they are compatible. 
  
  Reactive eXtensions is a set of implementations for different languages where 
  the vocabulary is standardized. Originally created by Microsoft, now open 
  sourced and maintained by the community.
  
  RxJs will be bundled with Angular 2.
