<!-- 
  Reactive streams is a specification used to build reactive systems.
  Reactive systems are systems that are:

    Responsive - the system should respond as soon as possible.
    Resilient - the system react to failure.
    Elastic - the system should stay responsive under varying workload by
    increasing/decreasing resource usage.
    Message Driven - the system relies on asynchornous message-passing to ensure
    loose coupling, isolation, and location transparency.

  It's the result of having big data and having the desire to understand that
  data quickly. The specification started around 2010 when four groups were
  trying to solve similiar problems.

<!--
  The result of their collaboration was the Reactive Streams specification. 
  It's a set of 4 interfaces that allow developers to build reactive systems 
  without requiring low-level knowledge needed to build reactive systems.

  Two goals of the specification are to ensure implementations:
    Manage stream data across asychronous boundaries (threads, networks, ...)
    Ensuring consumers are not forced to buffer any data

  These specifications will be available in Java 9 and possibly ES7.

  Reactive eXtensions is a set of implementations for different languages where 
  the vocabulary is standardized. Originally created by Microsoft, now open 
  sourced and maintained by the community. RxJava and RxJs are just two of the
  many Reactive eXtension implementations.
  
  RxJs will be bundled with Angular 2.
